# üöÄ SpaceX Slingshotter Game

This was entirely created by Grok 4. This is my benchmark to test models and I never expected Grok 4 to be able to do this, no matter what I added next it just accomplished. Sometimes I needed to try again or change the prompt ever so slightly but here it is.

I did not touch any part of the code. The only external help was the background which comes from https://www.spacespheremaps.com/wp-content/uploads/2D_starfield_diffraction_spikes_2.png and the Starship PNG which I used ChatGPT image generation (the best in my opinion).

It even created the sounds and chiptune from scratch (even though it first used Super Mario's one but I told it to make its own).

For the project hosted on GitHub Pages, I updated the URLs to use the assets locally but that's the only thing I changed in the code!

[Here's the whole Grok 4 conversation!](https://grok.com/share/c2hhcmQtMg%3D%3D_b0791734-8f8b-47e3-bad5-c6ad9ccfb69a)
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** The conversation is quite long, so it will take a while to load. xAI should really consider some optimizations here.

You will notice that the first prompt is super detailed; well, I used bolt.new Enhance prompt feature to do that. The rest was really just lazy prompting and it was enough!

In only one instance did I have to tell Grok to not generate an image but to add the image to the code.

Honestly, this is the best LLM model so far and I'm bullish on xAI!
